## Introduction

[](#introduction)

Holdstation defuture is developing hTrade, a liquidity-efficient, powerful, and user-friendly decentralized leveraged trading platform.

Our uniquely designed synthetic architecture makes hTrade more capital efficient than any existing platform, allows for low trading fees, and a wide range of leverages and pairs: up to 150x on cryptos, 1000x on forex, and 250x on commodities.

The protocol revolves around the ecosystem's ERC20 utility token ($HOLD). The $HOLD token is designed to be actively used within the platform (utility) and to allow ownership of the protocol through revenue capture & governance (soon). It includes $HOLD holders receiving platform fees through Single Sided Staking, as well as burning of $HOLD using platform revenue.

**We do not guarantee price appreciation or depreciation in the future, nor promise any development of the project compared to its current state, and if you buy the token, you do so at your own risk.**
